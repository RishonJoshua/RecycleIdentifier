# **Recycle Identifier**

The objective of this is to identify things that can be compostable or recyclable, based on pretrained data on the Resnet-18 model.

# **Set Up**

Created by training model on data from Kaggle and Images.CV to allow a classification and a percentage similarity to be displayed. This was done on the Jetson Nano and required me to run a docker.
